use postgreSQL instead of SQLite

========
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'

========
add console DB connected if connected.

========

Db failed.

name: postgres
host name/address: localhost
port: 5432
database: postgres
username: postgres
password: postgres

========

move everything from SQLite to PostgreSQL.
all data should store in PostgreSQL includes user, tags, images
And remove SQLite.


========

still something not working. old created files remained. everything should be real working with postgreSQL database.

there are no users in database user table. but login is working . this is wrong. fix.


========

you are really bad. all data should retrived from postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres.

But you are getting data from somewhere. fix it.

========
generate docker file

========

after docker run. login & register is not working. got internal server error. fix it.
